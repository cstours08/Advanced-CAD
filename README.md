# Gears

## Description
For this part we needed to follow a set of instructions to construct a gear and then use cool SolidWorks code magic to make 3 variations with very little effort. 
## Revaltions
* SolidWorks has so much potential as long as you maintain a level head and go through everything logically that way things will run smoothly because that is the way it was intended to be used.
* SolidWorks Tutorials on youtube are decrees of God, and also googling images of what your trying to find is very helpful. Not Bing, Google. Bing is the Anti-christ. 
* Calling on a "friend" (or someone better then you) for assitance is a great way to progress and get a fresh perspective on what you are working on.
