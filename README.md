# Gears

## Description
For this part we needed to follow a set of instructions to construct a gear and then use cool SolidWorks code magic to make 3 variations with very little effort. 

## Revelations

* SolidWorks has so much potential as long as you maintain a level head and go through everything logically that way things will run smoothly because that is the way it was intended to be used.
* SolidWorks Tutorials on youtube are decrees of God, and also googling images of what your trying to find is very helpful. Not Bing, Google. Bing is the Anti-christ. 
* Calling on a "friend" (or someone better then you) for assitance is a great way to progress and get a fresh perspective on what you are working on.

# Gearbox

## Description
This was a continuation or rather a completion of the gears assignment, in this portion we needed to create several subassemblies and many smaller parts, and then use those to create a main assembly that became a gearbox (ROOLLL CREDITS!!). The gearbox is capable of spinning any of the gears, and having all the other gears reacting appropriately     

## Revelations

* Always double check your mates, you will be better for it. Something that takes 3 seconds to fix can turn into something that takes days to fix if you leave it alone long enough and continue working in spite of it.
* Make sure you use paper and pencil to write out your logic, this helps you and those around you follow your process and helps you progress faster as it makes it relatively simple to walk people to the point you have gotten to. All and all having your plan written out is a wonderful saving grace.
* Think about your process, thinking about your thinking improves your thinking ([CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE), 2020).

# Motion Study

## Description
This assignment is completely separate from anything too do with gears, it consists of various custom built parts that you throw together into a brilliant machine that will always work perfectly. This contraption does the incredibly valuable task of moving a small platform up and down with the incredible strength of a single plastic servo, all powered by electricity. 

## Revelations
* Custom parts are fun, just make sure you follow the images it doesn’t take much to get thrown off.
* Solidworks tutorials are very useful, they give you a good demonstration of how too use features you have never used and some of them even explain the concepts behind them and give you the knowledge and understanding to use those tools to there fulles, fullest extent.  
* Always note any changes you make something as small as a convenient mate can be enough to screw over the next portion of a project.

# Stress Analysis

## Description
This "project" takes all of 10 minutes so long as you continue working on it, this was quite different then the past assignments as it focused very little on the actual part and so much more on what you can do to the part using the incredible SolidWorks. ## Revelations

## Revelations
* Follow instructions, disobedience serves no purpose. At least in this case. 
* SolidWorks has so much more then meets the eye, and that’s just when looking at the base program not including the unlimited sources of new features and materials that come from the community supporting it. 
* Use the features shown off during this brief assignment, they can prove very valuable when looking at the actual stability of your build.
